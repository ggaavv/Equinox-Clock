  Generic TCP Server Example Application

  Summary:
    Module for Microchip TCP/IP Stack
    
  Description:
    -Implements an example "ToUpper" TCP server on port 9760 and 
     should be used as a basis for creating new TCP server 
     applications

  Description of how to run the demo:
     1) Connect the ethernet port of the programmed demo board to a 
          computer either directly or through a router.
     2) Determine the IP address of the demo board.  This can be done several
          different ways.
        a) If you are using a demo setup with an LCD display (e.g. Explorer 16
             or PICDEM.net 2), the IP address should be displayed on the second
             line of the display.
        b) Open the Microchip Ethernet Device Discoverer from the start menu.
             Press the "Discover Devices" button to see the addresses and host
             names of all devices with the Announce Protocol enabled on your
             network.  You may have to configure your computer's firewall to 
             prevent it from blocking UDP port 30303 for this solution.
        c) If your board is connected directly with your computer with a
             crossover cable: 
                1) Open a command/DOS prompt and type 'ipconfig'.  Find the 
                     network adaptor that is connected to the board.  The IP
                     address of the board is located in the 'Default Gateway'
                    field
                2) Open up the network status for the network adaptor that
                     connects the two devices.  This can be done by right clicking
                     on the network connection icon in the network settings folder 
                     and select 'status' from the menu. Find the 'Default Gateway'
                     field.
     3) Open a command/DOS prompt.  Type "telnet ip_address 9760" where
          ip_address is the IP address that you got from step 2.
     4) As you type characters, they will be echoed back in your command prompt
          window in UPPER CASE.
     5) Press Escape to end the demo

  Function:
	void GenericTCPServer(void)

  Summary:
	Implements a simple ToUpper TCP Server.

  Description:
	This function implements a simple TCP server.  The function is invoked
	periodically by the stack to listen for incoming connections.  When a 
	connection is made, the server reads all incoming data, transforms it
	to uppercase, and echos it back.
	
	This example can be used as a model for many TCP server applications.

  Precondition:
	TCP is initialized.

  Parameters:
	None

  Returns:
  	None
