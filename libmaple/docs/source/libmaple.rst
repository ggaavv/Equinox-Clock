`LeafLabs libmaple <libmaple-libmaple>`_ is the low level library we have developed for for the ARM
Cortex-M3 chips manufactured by STMicroelectronics used in the Maple
boards (the `STM32F103x`_ series). We found the generic peripheral
libraries too painful to build on top of, and reimplemented the
functionality we needed in a simpler (and less general) form.

This library is transparently included in the `Maple IDE
<http://leaflabs.com/docs/maple-ide/>`_, but we develop it separately
using good old Unix command line tools and release it for advanced
users who might chafe at the “sketch” programming model of the
IDE. Included are some examples, a Makefile, and the compatibility
wrappers and code to imitate the Arduino programming library.
