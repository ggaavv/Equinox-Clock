double
======

Desciption
----------

Double precision floating point number. Occupies 4 bytes.



The double implementation on the Arduino is currently exactly the
same as the float, with no gain in precision.



Tip
---

Users who borrow code from other sources that includes double
variables may wish to examine the code to see if the implied
precision is different from that actually achieved on the Arduino.
