The pointer operators
=====================

& (reference) and \* (dereference)
==================================

Pointers are one of the more complicated subjects for beginners in
learning C, and it is possible to write the vast majority of
Arduino sketches without ever encountering pointers. However for
manipulating certain data structures, the use of pointers can
simplify the code, and and knowledge of manipulating pointers is
handy to have in one's toolkit.
