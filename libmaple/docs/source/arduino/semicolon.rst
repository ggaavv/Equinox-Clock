; semicolon
===========

Used to end a statement.



Example
~~~~~~~

::

    int a = 13;

Tip
---

Forgetting to end a line in a semicolon will result in a compiler
error. The error text may be obvious, and refer to a missing
semicolon, or it may not. If an impenetrable or seemingly illogical
compiler error comes up, one of the first things to check is a
missing semicolon, in the immediate vicinity, preceding the line at
which the compiler complained.
