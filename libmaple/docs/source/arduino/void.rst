void
====

The void keyword is used only in function declarations. It
indicates that the function is expected to return no information to
the function from which it was called.



Example:
--------

::

    // actions are performed in the functions "setup" and "loop"
    // but  no information is reported to the larger program
    
    void setup()
    {
      // ...
    }
    
    void loop()
    {
      // ...
    }
