/* The ADC input clock is generated from PCLK2/APB2 divided by a prescaler
 * and it must not exceed 14MHz.
 *
 * ADC1 and ADC2 are clocked by APB2
 *
 * 1) Power on by setting ADON in ADC_CR2
 * Conversion starts when ADON is set for a second time after some
 * time t > t_stab.
 *
 * Up to 16 selected conversion must be selected in ADC_SQRx
 *
 * Single conversion mode:
 * Set the ADON bit in the ADC_CR2 register
 * Once the conversion is complete:
 *  Converted data is stored in ADC_DR
 *  EOC flag is set
 *  Interrupt is generated if EOCIE is set
 *
 * Calibration:
 * Calibration is started by setting the CAL bit in the ADC_CR2 register.
 * Once calibration is over, the CAL bit is reset by hardware and normal
 * conversion can be performed. Calibrate at power-on.
 *
 * ALIGN in ADC_CR2 selects the alignment of data
 *
 * IMPORTANT: maximum external impedance must be below 0.4kOhms for 1.5
 * sample conversion time.
 *
 * At 55.5 cycles/sample, the external input impedance < 50kOhms*/
